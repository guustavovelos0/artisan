## Codebase Patterns
- Prisma 7 requires DATABASE_URL in prisma.config.ts, NOT in schema.prisma
- Use `npm run db:migrate -w @artisan/api` to run migrations (requires Docker PostgreSQL running)
- Generated Prisma client goes to node_modules/@prisma/client
- API runs on port 3001, Web will run on port 5173
- Pages go in apps/web/src/pages/ directory
- Use react-hook-form + zod for form validation with Shadcn form components
- API URL is http://localhost:3001/api
- Token and user stored in localStorage after auth
- Use ApiError class for typed error handling in catch blocks
- AuthContext provides isLoading state for showing loading spinners during auth check
- Layout component wraps protected routes for consistent sidebar/header navigation
- Use cn() utility from lib/utils to merge Tailwind classes conditionally
- API routes: use `router.use(authMiddleware)` for protected routes, cast params with `as string`
- ProductMaterial composite key pattern: use `productId_materialId: { productId, materialId }` for findUnique/update/delete
- CategoryManager pattern: inline CRUD modal with DialogTrigger, type prop for filtering, onCategoriesChange callback for refreshing
- Mobile responsiveness pattern: use `md:hidden` for mobile card layout, `hidden md:block` for desktop table layout

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Verified: Technical sheet endpoints already implemented in apps/api/src/routes/products.ts
- All endpoints tested via curl and working correctly:
  - GET /api/products/:id/materials - returns product's materials with quantities
  - POST /api/products/:id/materials - adds material to product
  - PUT /api/products/:id/materials/:materialId - updates material quantity
  - DELETE /api/products/:id/materials/:materialId - removes material from product
  - GET /api/products/:id/cost - calculates total cost (materialCost + laborCost)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ProductMaterial has composite unique key: `@@unique([productId, materialId])`
  - Use `productId_materialId` object for Prisma composite key queries
  - Cost calculation: sum of (quantity × unitPrice) for each material + laborCost
  - Material cost breakdown returned with individual material costs for UI display
  - Always validate both product ownership and material ownership before adding to technical sheet

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented: Product form page for creating and editing products
- Files changed:
  - apps/web/src/pages/ProductFormPage.tsx (new - form for create/edit products with category dropdown)
  - apps/web/src/App.tsx (added routes for /products/new and /products/:id)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Same pattern as MaterialFormPage for form pages
  - Use string type for numeric form fields to avoid z.coerce.number() typing issues with react-hook-form
  - Convert strings to numbers with parseFloat()/parseInt() in onSubmit before sending to API
  - Fetch categories with type filter: `/categories?type=PRODUCT`
  - Products use Int for quantity (not Float like materials) since they're whole units
  - Edit mode shows "Update Product" button, create mode shows "Create Product"

  - Use `disabled={(date) => date < new Date(new Date().setHours(0, 0, 0, 0))}` to disable past dates
  - Client dropdown fetches with high limit (?limit=1000) to get all clients for selection
  - Form uses separate loading state for clients fetch vs quote fetch in edit mode
  - Placeholder item `{ description: 'Item placeholder', quantity: 1, unitPrice: 0 }` needed for create since API requires at least one item
  - Edit mode (isEditing) determined by presence of id from useParams
  - validUntil stored as Date in form, converted to ISO string for API

- Implemented: CurrencyInput component with R$ prefix for currency fields
- Files changed:
  - apps/web/src/components/ui/currency-input.tsx (new - reusable currency input with R$ prefix)
  - apps/web/src/pages/ProductFormPage.tsx (updated - price, laborCost fields use CurrencyInput)
  - apps/web/src/pages/MaterialFormPage.tsx (updated - unitPrice field uses CurrencyInput)
  - apps/web/src/pages/QuoteFormPage.tsx (updated - unitPrice in items, laborCost, discount, manualTotal use CurrencyInput)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - CurrencyInput wraps a div with position relative and absolute positioned span for the prefix
  - Use pl-10 (left padding) to accommodate the R$ prefix text
  - Pass currencySymbol prop to customize (defaults to "R$")
  - Component extends all standard input props except type (forced to "number")
  - step="0.01" and min="0" are set as defaults for currency behavior
  - Width may need adjustment (w-32 to w-36) when using with prefix to fit content

- Implemented: CategoryManager component for inline category CRUD management
- Files changed:
  - apps/api/src/routes/categories.ts (fixed - added type query param filtering)
  - apps/web/src/components/CategoryManager.tsx (new - modal for managing categories inline)
  - apps/web/src/pages/ProductFormPage.tsx (updated - added CategoryManager button next to category selector)
  - apps/web/src/pages/MaterialFormPage.tsx (updated - added CategoryManager button next to category selector)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - API GET /categories endpoint was missing type filter - categories should filter by ?type=PRODUCT or ?type=MATERIAL
  - Use DialogTrigger asChild pattern to create a button that opens a dialog
  - CategoryManager takes type prop ('PRODUCT' | 'MATERIAL') and onCategoriesChange callback
  - Settings2 icon from lucide-react works well for "manage" actions
  - Inline editing in table: use state to track editingCategory and editName
  - onKeyDown handler for Enter/Escape for quick save/cancel during editing
  - Always add type="button" to buttons inside forms to prevent form submission

- Implemented: Mobile responsive card layout for products page
- Files changed:
  - apps/web/src/pages/ProductsPage.tsx (updated - added mobile card layout with md:hidden, kept desktop table with hidden md:block)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Mobile responsiveness pattern: use md:hidden for mobile-only elements, hidden md:block for desktop-only
  - Card layout should include: product name (h3), category (p with text-muted-foreground), grid for stats, action buttons in border-t section
  - Use flex-1 on primary action button (Edit) to make it take remaining space
  - Keep icon-only buttons for secondary actions (Technical Sheet, Manufacture, Delete) on mobile to save space
  - Empty state should be handled in both layouts separately
  - Same isLowStock helper function and amber styling works for both layouts

- Implemented: Unit input converted from free-text Input to Select dropdown
- Files changed:
  - apps/web/src/pages/MaterialFormPage.tsx (updated - unit field now uses Select with predefined options)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - UNIT_OPTIONS constant array pattern for dropdown options: `{ value: 'kg', label: 'kg (quilogramas)' }`
  - Radix UI Select components can be tricky to interact with in Playwright automated tests (click doesn't always trigger open)
  - Use `page.evaluate(() => trigger.click())` via JavaScript if direct click doesn't work
  - Select component already imported from Shadcn, no new dependencies needed
  - Existing materials with units outside the predefined list will still work - the Select just won't show a selected value initially

- Implemented: Mobile card layout for materials page
- Files changed:
  - apps/web/src/pages/MaterialsPage.tsx (added mobile card layout with md:hidden, desktop table with hidden md:block)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Same mobile responsive pattern as ProductsPage (US-044): md:hidden for mobile cards, hidden md:block for desktop table
  - Mobile card structure: header (name + category), stats grid (stock, unit, price), action buttons in border-t section
  - Low stock badge uses same amber styling (text-amber-600, bg-amber-50) in both mobile and desktop layouts
  - flex-1 on primary action button (Editar) makes it take remaining space
  - Delete button is icon-only on mobile to save horizontal space
  - Empty state handled separately in both mobile and desktop layouts
