# Ralph Progress Log - Artisan App
# Branch: ralph/artisan-management-app
# Started: 2026-01-16
# =========================================

## Codebase Patterns
- Package naming: @artisan/api, @artisan/web, @artisan/shared
- Root dev script uses concurrently to run api and web together
- TypeScript is used across all packages
- API runs on port 3001, Web runs on port 5173

- What was implemented: Monorepo structure with npm workspaces
- Files changed:
  - package.json (root with workspaces config)
  - apps/api/package.json, tsconfig.json, src/index.ts
  - apps/web/package.json, tsconfig.json, src/index.ts
  - packages/shared/package.json, tsconfig.json, src/index.ts
  - .gitignore
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Workspace packages reference each other via "*" in dependencies (e.g., "@artisan/shared": "*")
  - API package needs @types/node for console.log to typecheck
  - Root typecheck runs all workspace typechecks with `npm run typecheck --workspaces --if-present`

- What was implemented: Docker Compose configuration for PostgreSQL 15
- Files changed:
  - docker-compose.yml (new file at root)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Docker Compose uses named volume `postgres_data` for data persistence
  - Database credentials: artisan_db / artisan / artisan123
  - Includes healthcheck for reliable startup detection
  - Container name: artisan_postgres

- What was implemented: Express server with TypeScript and hot reload
- Files changed:
  - apps/api/package.json (added express, cors, ts-node-dev dependencies)
  - apps/api/src/index.ts (Express server with CORS and health endpoint)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Express 5.x is the current version (installed 5.2.1)
  - ts-node-dev with --respawn --transpile-only provides fast hot reload
  - CORS configured to allow requests from localhost:5173 (frontend)
  - Health check endpoint at GET /api/health returns { status: 'ok' }
  - Use underscore prefix for unused params (_req) to avoid TypeScript errors
